ADAS Project
Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) using YOLOv8

Overview
This project implements an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) using YOLOv8 for real-time object detection. The system captures video input, processes it using computer vision, and detects objects like vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles to enhance driving safety.

📌 Features
✅ Real-time object detection using YOLOv8
✅ Uses OpenCV for video processing
✅ Detects vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles
✅ Displays annotated frames with detected objects

🛠 Tech Stack
Python
OpenCV (for video capture & display)
YOLOv8 (for object detection)
Ultralytics library
